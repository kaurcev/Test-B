# Test-B

Implement a client application.
There are 5,000 targets moving around, with the player having ability to shoot at them. A hit removes the target from the scene. After the start of the game, the player has 1 minute of play time. Once it's out, show a screen with basic statistics such as amount of shots, amount of targets hit, % of hits and % of misses.

##Installation

You need to download and unpack the archive.
Then just go to localhost or to the domain where you want to see the work of this application


###Note

Due to incorrect translation, I did not understand the essence of this task.

I implemented a player who can shoot, 5000 objects obscured the playing field too much and I put a slider in the lower right corner where you can adjust the number of those objects (the maximum value of the slider is 5000)

There is also a time limit implemented and statistics are shown at the end.

```I recommend running this code on localhost.```
