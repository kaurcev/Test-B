# Test-B

##Installation

You need to download and unpack the archive.
Then just go to localhost or to the domain where you want to see the work of this application

###Note

Due to incorrect translation, I did not understand the essence of this task.

I implemented a player who can shoot, 5000 objects obscured the playing field too much and I put a slider in the lower right corner where you can adjust the number of those objects (the maximum value of the slider is 5000)

There is also a time limit implemented and statistics are shown at the end.

```I recommend running this code on localhost.```
